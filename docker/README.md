# Docker
## Presentation
Trying to make a kind of "Docker environment" that would help in both development and production.
There is currently a [maker.sh](https://github.com/MuchChaca/simple-contact-list/blob/docker-v-0.01/docker/maker.sh) file building the frontend and the backend. 
It sure helps and prevents from having to build the front, reposition it, change paths and build the backend then put everything back to normal... 
Docker is going to help for that.  

## Goal
* Make a dynamic dev environment with Docker, meaning that all changes made in backend/frontend will be dynamicly shown at save.
* Have an easy way to deploy

## Use
***The use of this "Docker environment" will be there as soon as it will be done.***
